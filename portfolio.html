    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In May 2020, I graduated from the Full-time MBA program at Isenberg School of Management, University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
    <p>My work background in public libraries and food co-ops has given me a sense that data tools and business skills can be put to use for the good of local communities.</p>
    <p>As I move forward into this wild pandemic world, I'm currently adding coding to my skillset through an eight-week bootcamp at <a href="https://www.techtalentsouth.com/">Tech Talent South.</a></p>
